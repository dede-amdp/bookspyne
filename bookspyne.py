@name: Introduction
@notes: 
Bookspyne is a tool written in python that can be used to merge multiple Markdown files together and create a table of contents for them.
The tool will automatically get all the headers of the file and list them, automatically creating a link that will bring to the specified paragraph or section for each of them.
Here's how it works:
There are two ways to use this tool

### 1 Using a Table of Contents file
Create a normal txt (or md) file (the name is not important) structured as follows:
```
title: {Title}
{filename1}
...
{filenameN}
```
where the string that follows "title:" will be used as a title assigned to the merged files (it will appear with a bigger font and centerd)
and each new line shows a file that will be merged in the completed document.

**After moving in the directory where the file "bookspyne.py" was created**, type in the console:
```console
python bookspyne.py -i {toc_file}.txt -o {output_filename}.md
```
where the {toc_file}.txt file is the Table of contents file created previously and the {output_filename} is the filename of the output file containing all the merged files.

### 2 Using a Source Directory
In this case, specify the directory where all the files that will be merged are located, then use the following command:
```console
python bookspyne.py --fromdir {source_directory} -t {Title}
```
the command will use the {source_directory} path to get all the files needed and the {Title}, as you might have guessed, as a title for the whole document.

# Installing the tool
If PIP is installed on your machine, you can clone this repository and use the following command:
```console
pip install -e {cloned repo directory path}
```
this will enable the use of the command without specifying the environment and the file path, just by using `bookspyne`:
```console
bookspyne -i {toc_file}.txt -o {output_filename}.md
```
will be equivalent as:
```console
python bookspyne.py -i {toc_file}.txt -o {output_filename}.md
```

"""Usage:
    -o: output file title
    -i: input file title
    -t: title of the completed file
    --fromdir: source directory base
    --usage: prints usage information
Example usage:
python bookspyne.py -i {toc_file}.txt -o {output_file}.md

from this command, a file named {output_file}.md will be created containing
the files listed in the {toc_file}.txt (as explained below) all merged together
with an automatic table of content

Using: 
python bookspyne.py
is equivalent to:
python bookspyne.py -i ./toc.txt -o ./out/out.md

Example usage:
python bookspyne.py --fromdir {dir_path} -t {Title} -o {output_file}.md

from this command, a file named {output_file}.md will be created containing
all the files in the specified {dir_path} directory sorted by name all merged 
together with an automatic table of content title with the string "{Title}"

The -t flag is madatory if the --fromdir flag is used, while it will be ignored
if the -i argument is used

How to create a Table Of Content file:
- create a .txt file
- within it define:
    - a title with the string "title: {title}".
    - in a new line for each, add the path of 
    the files that will be merged together

Table of Content file Example:
title: Example
./file1.md
./file2.md
...
./lastfile.md

from this Table of Content file the file that will be created
will have as title the string "Example" and as contents 
the contents of the listed files in the listed order.
