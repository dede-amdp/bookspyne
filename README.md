# Bookspyne

Bookspyne is a tool written in python that can be used to merge multiple Markdown files together and create a table of contents for them.
The tool will automatically get all the headers of the file and list them, automatically creating a link that will bring to the specified paragraph or section for each of them.

## Quick Start

```console
pip install -e {cloned repo directory path}
